**-- Canonn Decryptor Tool --**

The Canonn Decryptor is a web application which might be useful for the usual minor crypto puzzle solving. I already introduced an early version of it in the R&D channel some months ago and used a VERY early version of it during the last Canonnball Run but I think it is now ready for the public. Some current features are:

```
* Support for various ciphers/converters (Atbash, Caesar, Keyword, Morse, Number-to-Ascii, Reverse, Roman numerals, Vigen√®re).
* For most ciphers the Decryptor also supports encoding and not just decoding so it can also be used to actually create crypto puzzles.
* Automatic keyword cipher cracking.
* Automatic caesar rotation cracking.
* Live-decrypting (Output is updated while typing the input).
* Output-Chaining (Outputs can again be decoded into another output).
* Advanced input parsing so converters always respects case-sensitivity, line-breaks and white-spacing in general and only converts the parts from the input the converter knows about while the rest is passed through unmodified for the next converter.
```

The Decryptor itself can be found here: <https://kayahr.github.io/canonn-decryptor/>

And here are some historical examples: 

* The Asp is Yellow: <https://goo.gl/tt1tEp>
* Canonnball Run 2 Puzzle 3: <https://goo.gl/QhFRKG>
* Communication Hub Zeta 12: <https://goo.gl/932U7j>

I hope this tool is helpful in some way for decrypting the secrets of the universe. If you find bugs or want to suggest improvements then please do so on 
Github (<https://github.com/kayahr/canonn-decryptor/>).

**-- EXTool --**

Beige patrol just got easier  Sileo has created an amazing tool that allows you to send your position over a planet surface to a central database so it can be viewed by other commanders. 
If you have dual screens you can display a 3d map with your track and position in real time. All you need is EDMC and a PC. 

Console users wont be able to contribute data but you can still use the maps on a phone or tablet to avoid searching where others have gone before
