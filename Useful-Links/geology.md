__**The following is a list of best practices for reporting a new surface site.**__

1)The top requirement is a cockpit screenshot of the site that captures the following pieces of data:
     A) Latitude and Longitude, all digits should be clearly visible
     B) Body information (i.e. system + body strings).  Body must be targeted in order for this information to appear on the panel to the left of the radar.  The user must have conducted a Detailed Surface Scan of the body in order for the name (and other metadata) to be available.
     C) A surface site feature should be front and center, such as a Fumarole.  If site is currently on the night side of the body, be sure to have ship lights activated.
2) In the case of volcanic sites, the site type should be one of the 3 known types.
     A) Fumarole (strictly smokey phenomenon)
     B) Geyser (has nodes that spew liquid and nodes that spew jets of gas)
     C) Lava Spout (the so-called “campfires” that spew glowing lava)
3) If the new site does not conform to a known phenomenon, then it should be reported as “Unknown” or “Undetermined” with the following form <https://canonn.fyi/report>
